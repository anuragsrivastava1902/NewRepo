	<h1>Bharat Ratna P V Narasimha Rao: 4 things you did not know about the man who changed India’s economy</h1>
	<p>Mandal in the Modi Mantra stands for the importance given to OBCs under his government, with the PM himself an OBC. Karpoori Thakur and Charan Singh both belonged to backward classes, with Thakur really the father of the Mandal phenomenon. As chief minister of Bihar in 1978, he introduced 26% reservation for OBCs in government jobs, and when the decision was met with violent protests, he decided to set aside 3% for the EWS (economically weaker sections) and another 3% for women – a harbinger of things to come in later years.</p>
